# Eve Online Alert

EVE Alert - Check every 2-3 seconds if the Local has an Enemy or Neutral in System and play a sound if someone is there!

## Features

- Play Sound on Local Detection
- Easy-Use Interface
- Start/Stop System

## Planned Features

- Call Drones back
- Warp to Destination
- Maybe in future - Auto Mining System

## Usage
- Simply launch Alert.exe, and a menu will appear. You can configure all your settings there. Afterward, click on "Start."
- If the Alert doesn't respond to the local chat, you can reduce the detection accuracy or double-check if you've set the region correctly.
- If both settings are 100% accurate and your interface is not blurred, make sure that your neutral symbol looks like this:

Neutral:    ![Neutral](https://i.imgur.com/SdjoIs6.png) or ![Neutral](https://i.imgur.com/L7hy58Y.png) (higher accuracy)

Enemys:     ![Red](https://i.imgur.com/O0VTT69.png)

You can edit all images & sounds by yourself only the name must be the same

## Testing
- Important note: Resolution Scaling is also an issue why it not works
