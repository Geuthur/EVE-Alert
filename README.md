# Eve Online Alert

This Alert is written in Python

## Features

- Play Sound on Local Detection
- Easy-Use Interface
- Start/Stop System

## Planned Features

- Call Drones back
- Warp to Destination

## Usage
- Simply launch Alert.exe, and a menu will appear. You can configure all your settings there. Afterward, click on "Start."
- If the Alert doesn't respond to the local environment, you can reduce the detection accuracy or double-check if you've set the region correctly.
- If both settings are 100% accurate and your interface is not blurred, make sure that your neutral symbol looks like this:
