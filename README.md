# Eve Online Alert

EVE Alert - Check every 2-3 seconds if the Local has an Enemy or Neutral in System and play a sound if someone is there!

## Features

- Play Sound on Local Detection
- Easy-Use Interface
- Start/Stop System

## Planned Features

- Call Drones back
- Warp to Destination
- Maybe in future - Auto Mining System

## Usage
- Simply launch Alert.exe, and a menu will appear. You can configure all your settings there. Afterward, click on "Start."
- If the Alert doesn't respond to the local environment, you can reduce the detection accuracy or double-check if you've set the region correctly.
- If both settings are 100% accurate and your interface is not blurred, make sure that your neutral symbol looks like this:

Neutral:    ![Neutral](https://i.imgur.com/SdjoIs6.png)

Enemys:     ![Red](https://i.imgur.com/O0VTT69.png)

You can edit all images & sounds by yourself only the name must be the same

## Testing

- You can test the Script without starting EVE Online, Just open the image "localtest" and start the script, set the region to the image and you will see if it works.
- Important note: Resolution Scaling is also an issue why it not works ![Window](https://i.imgur.com/e0X2sGM.png)
